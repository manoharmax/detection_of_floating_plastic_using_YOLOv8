# detection_of_floating_plastic_using_YOLOv8
## Project Description

This project focuses on detecting floating plastic waste on water surfaces using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. 
The system aims to support environmental monitoring by identifying plastic debris in real time from images or video streams.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision

## How It Works
1. Input images or video frames containing water surfaces are provided to the system.
2. The YOLOv8 model processes each frame to detect floating plastic objects.
3. Detected plastic waste is highlighted using bounding boxes with confidence scores.
4. The output enables monitoring and analysis of plastic pollution in water bodies.
